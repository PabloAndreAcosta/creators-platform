// Refund a booking's Stripe charge correctly for BOTH charge shapes.

// Ticket/experience checkouts use CONNECT DESTINATION CHARGES
// (payment_intent_data.transfer_data.destination + application_fee_amount):
// the gross already moved to the organizer's connected account and Usha's cut
// went to the platform as an application fee. A plain refunds.create({payment_
// intent}) refunds the BUYER from the PLATFORM balance but does NOT claw back
// the organizer's transfer or return the application fee — so Usha eats the
// whole amount on every ticket refund. That was the bug this fixes.
//
// For a destination charge we set reverse_transfer + refund_application_fee so
// the refund is funded by the organizer's transfer and Usha's fee is returned
// proportionally — the buyer is made whole, nobody is out of pocket. For a
// plain (non-Connect) charge those flags are omitted (Stripe rejects them).
